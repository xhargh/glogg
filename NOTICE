This product includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>
liblzma that is in the public domain.

//XZ Utils Licensing
//==================
//
//    Different licenses apply to different files in this package. Here
//    is a rough summary of which licenses apply to which parts of this
//    package (but check the individual files to be sure!):
//
//      - liblzma is in the public domain.
//
//      - xz, xzdec, and lzmadec command line tools are in the public
//        domain unless GNU getopt_long had to be compiled and linked
//        in from the lib directory. The getopt_long code is under
//        GNU LGPLv2.1+.
//
//      - The scripts to grep, diff, and view compressed files have been
//        adapted from gzip. These scripts and their documentation are
//        under GNU GPLv2+.
//
//      - All the documentation in the doc directory and most of the
//        XZ Utils specific documentation files in other directories
//        are in the public domain.
//
//      - Translated messages are in the public domain.
//
//      - The build system contains public domain files, and files that
//        are under GNU GPLv2+ or GNU GPLv3+. None of these files end up
//        in the binaries being built.
//
//      - Test files and test code in the tests directory, and debugging
//        utilities in the debug directory are in the public domain.
//
//      - The extra directory may contain public domain files, and files
//        that are under various free software licenses.
//
//    You can do whatever you want with the files that have been put into
//    the public domain. If you find public domain legally problematic,
//    take the previous sentence as a license grant. If you still find
//    the lack of copyright legally problematic, you have too many
//    lawyers.
//
//    As usual, this software is provided "as is", without any warranty.
//
//    If you copy significant amounts of public domain code from XZ Utils
//    into your project, acknowledging this somewhere in your software is
//    polite (especially if it is proprietary, non-free software), but
//    naturally it is not legally required. Here is an example of a good
//    notice to put into "about box" or into documentation:
//
//        This software includes code from XZ Utils <https://tukaani.org/xz/>.
//
//    The following license texts are included in the following files:
//      - COPYING.LGPLv2.1: GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
//      - COPYING.GPLv2: GNU General Public License version 2
//      - COPYING.GPLv3: GNU General Public License version 3
//
//    Note that the toolchain (compiler, linker etc.) may add some code
//    pieces that are copyrighted. Thus, it is possible that e.g. liblzma
//    binary wouldn't actually be in the public domain in its entirety
//    even though it contains no copyrighted code from the XZ Utils source
//    package.
//
//    If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask the author(s) for more
//    information.
