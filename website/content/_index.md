## Faster log explorer

_klogg_ is a multi-platform GUI application to search through all kinds of text log files using regular expressions. It is fork of [glogg project](https://glogg.bonnefon.org/) created by [Nicolas Bonnefon](https://github.com/nickbnf).

_klogg_ is designed to:

 - be fast
 - handle huge log files
 - provide a clear view of the matches even in heavily cluttered files.

General usage can be described as simple loop:

{{< mermaid >}}

graph TD;
    A[Search for some regular expression]-->B[Mark interesting lines to keep in results window];
    B-->A;
  
{{< /mermaid >}}

 Using this pattern you can get full picture of what was happening at the time of logging.

## Features
{{< columns >}}
 _klogg_ inherited a lot of features from _glogg_

 - Runs on Unix-like systems, Windows and Mac thanks to Qt5
 - Displays search results separately from original file
 - Supports Perl-compatible regular expressions
 - Colorizes the log and search results
 - Displays a context view of where in the log the lines of interest are
 - Is fast and reads the file directly from disk, without loading it into memory
 - Watches for file changes on disk and reloads it (kind of like tail)
 - Is open source, released under the GPL

<--->

_klogg_ improves and brings more

 - Builds initial file index significantly faster
 - Uses multiple CPU cores to do regular expression matching
 - Detects log file encoding using uchardet library (support utf8, utf16, cp1251 and more)
 - Allows to perform search in a portion of huge log file
 - Keeps in-memory cache of search results per search pattern
 - Allows to paste some text from clipboard for further analysis
 - Has portable version for Windows (no need to install)
