## Privacy policy

We strongly support your right to privacy when using klogg.

Our privacy policy is simple: your data is none of our business. 

To the extent that klogg app and website can provide their functionality without doing so, we prefer to avoid collecting data from you.

In the cases where we do collect data, we try to be clear about why we're collecting it, tell you how long we keep it, delete it when we no longer need it, and give you the ability to opt out of collection whenever possible.

### Crash Logs
By default, if klogg crashes while you're using it, anonymized data about the crash will be collected to help us identify the cause of the crash and hopefully fix it in a future update. These "crash logs" contain technical information about the state of the app during the crash (processor information, operating system version, process and thread information, stack traces for each thread, the list of loaded modules)

Whenever possible, klogg will allow you to review the entire contents of the crash log before you decide whether or not to send it.

No data is sent from klogg without explicit user confirmation.

These data is sent for processing to [Sentry](https://sentry.io). Please read their [privacy policy](https://sentry.io/privacy/) and [security](https://sentry.io/security/).

We retain crash logs for 30 days.

Apple may also collect crash logs if the privacy settings of your device allow it.

### Update Checking
By default, klogg periodically check to see if a newer version of the app is available, so that you can be given the choice to update if you wish.

An update check request is done by downloading file from klogg Github repository. This request does not contain any data.

You may turn off update checking from the app's preferences window.

We do not store any metadata about update requests.

### Data Not Collected
Except as described above, and as required to perform the application's core functionality at the user's request, klogg does not send out any private information. This includes:

 - Your keyboard input
 - Contents of files you are working with
 - Screen contents
 - Hostnames
 - Filenames
 - Usernames
 - Passwords

### Questions and Feedback
Our privacy policies might change or be edited for clarity over time. Up-to-date information will always be available from this page.

Please [contact us](https://github.com/vairar) if you have any questions about our data collection or privacy policies. We'll be more than happy to discuss them with you.
